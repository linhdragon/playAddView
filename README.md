Testing how to add view in play 
Eclipse can not update immediately compile, so in the process, may be IDE will show Compile error




- add view:
create a new view  -> add new view into controller: play does not compile this view immediately

fix this:

- Refresh browser : in console will compile and reload programe
- Refresh project: F5 -> eclipse will load update compile and remove compile error
